# Prepare OpenWhisk projects for a release

  1. Make sure all unit and integration tests are passing in all the projects to be release. Check the [project list](general_spec.md#list-of-openwhisk-repositories-to-be-released).
  2. Make sure the license file LICENSE.txt and the notice file NOTICE.txt exist in each project repository. The license
  file contains the Apache V2.0 license and the notice file includes the dependencies.
  3. Update the release notes. (It is still to be determined where to publish the release notes)
  4. Update the changelog file CHANGELOG.txt for each project, including the new commits based on the previous release.
